## Getting Started

This the Gas Station project for the First Semester in Java Programming - BSIT-I.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: contains ```javafx.controls``` and ```java.fxml``` JARs.
- `src/img`: contains the images used on the app

## Dependency Management

This application requires JavaFX JDK. The JDK I used can be downloaded from [Gluon website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
